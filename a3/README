To compile the rpc library, run: 
make 
in the rpc directory;

To compile the PartialTestCode, run:
make clean; make
int the PartialTestCode directory;

To compile the custom client or server, add -pthread to it compile the code as follows:
g++ -L. client.o -lrpc -pthread -o client
g++ -L. serverfunctions.o serverfunctionskels.o server.o -lrpc -pthread -o server
(assuming librpc.a is placed in the current directory and the above.o files are correctly generated)

To recompile the client or server, make sure to clean up all files generated from previous compilation first, if
librpc.a has been modified.
